# Hi, I'm Szabolcs 👨‍💻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making and contributing to open-source codes. Love to create software to make my (or others) life easier. I love to contribute so I can build communities and get new friends.  
Technologies I currently enjoy working with include Vue.JS, JavaScript (Node.JS) and C#.
